# Hover Debug Overlay — Privacy Policy

This extension does not collect, transmit, or sell personal data.

User preferences are stored **locally** using `chrome.storage.local` (`overlayActive`, `showTagName`, `showEdgeLabels`).

The clipboard is written **only** when you select “Copy Element Name” from the context menu.

The extension makes **no** network requests, uses no analytics, and loads no remote code.
